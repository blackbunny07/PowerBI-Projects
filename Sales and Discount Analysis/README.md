# Project Purpose
This project analyzes sales, discount, and inventory performance across products and customers, with the goal of identifying high-performing items, underperformers, customer buying behavior, and the effectiveness of discounting strategies. This analysis supports data-driven decision-making in sales, pricing, inventory, and customer retention strategies.

# Executive Summary
This report addresses the challenge of optimizing sales performance and inventory management in a retail environment characterized by uneven product demand, inconsistent discounting practices, and concentrated customer purchasing behavior. The lack of clear alignment between discount strategies and sales outcomes, combined with underperformance of certain inventory items, has raised concerns about pricing efficiency, revenue leakage, and missed opportunities for growth.

The analysis of sales data includes product sales volume, total discounts given, customer purchase patterns, and product pricing. The results uncovered several critical findings:

- **Product Performance Disparity:** Asparagus emerged as the highest-selling and most expensive product, indicating strong market demand and pricing strength. Conversely, products like Lemon significantly underperformed in sales, suggesting potential issues with customer preference, visibility, or pricing.

- **Ineffective Discount Application:** A scatterplot analysis revealed no consistent relationship between quantity sold and discount applied. While a few high-discount, high-quantity outliers were observed (likely bulk deals), the overall pattern suggests that discounts are not being systematically used to drive volume across the board.

- **Customer Purchase Concentration:** A small number of customers account for a disproportionate share of quantity sold. This concentration introduces revenue risk and highlights the need for strategic customer engagement.

# Insights
### Product Performance
- Asparagus is the top-selling and most expensive product, indicating strong demand and pricing power.
- Lemon is the least sold product, requiring investigation.
- Most top-selling products are vegetables; fruits dominate the lower sales ranks.

### Discount Analysis
- There is no strong correlation between quantity sold and discount given.
- A few high-quantity, high-discount outliers exist â€” likely bulk deals.
- Vegetables tend to receive more discounting than fruits.
### Customer Behavior
- A few customers (e.g., Amina Loo) account for a disproportionate share of total quantity sold.
- There's potential for customer loyalty and targeted offers.

# Recommendations
### Promote High-Performing Products
- Continue pushing Asparagus with bundles or placement in promotions.
- Highlight other top sellers like Carrot and Rhubarb.

### Review Underperformers
- Conduct root cause analysis for Lemon's poor performance (pricing, stock levels, demand).

### Refine Discount Strategy
- Implement tiered discounts to encourage more bulk purchasing.
- Audit outliers with high discounts to ensure strategic pricing.

### Leverage High-Value Customers
- Offer personalized deals or early access promotions to top buyers.
- Create a loyalty program targeting high-quantity purchasers.

### Category-Based Pricing Tactics
- Consider separating discount strategies for fruits vs. vegetables based on historical performance.

# Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Potential Risks
### Quetions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement
- What is the target margin for each product category?
- Are there seasonal effects influencing sales/discount patterns?
- Do we have customer satisfaction or feedback data for low-performing products like Lemon?
- Are current discounts manually or automatically applied?
- Is the goal to increase sales volume, revenue, or profit margin?
- Are stock levels or supply chain constraints impacting product availability?
- Were there any internal business decisions (pricing changes, distribution shifts) that might have contributed to lower sales?
- Which regions or product lines are currently receiving the most marketing and sales investments?
- Are we targeting a geographic area or demographic group?
- Do we need to consider trends in neighboring markets or regions?
- Are there known supply chain constraints we need to account for in the recommendations?

### Potential Risks
- **Discount Overuse Risk:** Without clear Return on Investment (ROI) tracking, discounts may erode margins unnecessarily.

- **Product Overdependence:** Over-reliance on products like Asparagus could hurt sales if supply issues arise.

- **Customer Concentration Risk:** Losing a few top customers (like Amina Loo) could have a large impact on revenue.

- **Data Granularity Limitation:** Without knowing the time frame or order-level details, analysis may miss trends over time.

- **Assumption Risk:** Patterns observed may not hold in future periods or different markets if customer behavior shifts.
