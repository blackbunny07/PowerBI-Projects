# Project Purpose
this project analyzes sales performance trends over time of a global corporation, comparing Year-to-Date (YTD) sales against Previous Year-to-Date (PYTD) sales. By identifying key drivers of sales decline and product performance, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights to improve revenue, optimize product strategies, and address underperforming areas.
# Executive Summary
The sales performance analysis indicates a significant decline in YTD sales compared to PYTD, with an overall drop of $6.82M. The most substantial decline occurred between March and May, after which sales plateaued before showing minor recovery in Q4. All product categories (Indoor, Landscape, and Outdoor) contributed to this decline, with no single category outperforming expectations. Additionally, the bottom five performing countries (China, Brazil, Poland, Philippines, and France) reflect regions with severe sales underperformance.

# Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Potential Risks
### Quetions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement
- Are there any known external market factors (e.g., economic downturns, competitor movements) that could explain the decline?
- Were there any internal business decisions (pricing changes, distribution shifts) that might have contributed to lower sales?
- Which regions or product lines are currently receiving the most marketing and sales investments?
- Are there any upcoming strategic initiatives (e.g., product launches, expansions) that should be factored into this analysis?
- Are we targeting a geographic area or demographic group?
- Do we need to consider trends in neighboring markets or regions?
- Should external factors like economic conditions or promotions be incorporated into the analysis?
- Are there known supply chain constraints we need to account for in the recommendations?
- How flexible is the current inventory system for adjusting stock levels?
- Are there any resource limitations or supply chain constraints we should be aware of?
