# Project Purpose
This project analyzes sales, discount, and inventory performance across products and customers, with the goal of identifying high-performing items, underperformers, customer buying behavior, and the effectiveness of discounting strategies. This analysis supports data-driven decision-making in sales, pricing, inventory, and customer retention strategies.

# Executive Summary
This report addresses the challenge of optimizing sales performance and inventory management in a retail environment characterized by uneven product demand, inconsistent discounting practices, and concentrated customer purchasing behavior. The lack of clear alignment between discount strategies and sales outcomes, combined with underperformance of certain inventory items, has raised concerns about pricing efficiency, revenue leakage, and missed opportunities for growth.

The analysis of sales data includes product sales volume, total discounts given, customer purchase patterns, and product pricing. The results uncovered several critical findings:

- **Product Performance Disparity:** Asparagus emerged as the highest-selling and most expensive product, indicating strong market demand and pricing strength. Conversely, products like Lemon significantly underperformed in sales, suggesting potential issues with customer preference, visibility, or pricing.

- **Ineffective Discount Application:** A scatterplot analysis revealed no consistent relationship between quantity sold and discount applied. While a few high-discount, high-quantity outliers were observed (likely bulk deals), the overall pattern suggests that discounts are not being systematically used to drive volume across the board.

- **Customer Purchase Concentration:** A small number of customers account for a disproportionate share of quantity sold. This concentration introduces revenue risk and highlights the need for strategic customer engagement.

# Insights
### Product Performance
- Asparagus is the top-selling and most expensive product, indicating strong demand and pricing power.
- Lemon is the least sold product, requiring investigation.
- Most top-selling products are vegetables; fruits dominate the lower sales ranks.
### Discount Analysis
- There is no strong correlation between quantity sold and discount given.
- A few high-quantity, high-discount outliers exist â€” likely bulk deals.
- Vegetables tend to receive more discounting than fruits.
### Customer Behavior
- A few customers (e.g., Amina Loo) account for a disproportionate share of total quantity sold.
- There's potential for customer loyalty and targeted offers.

# Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Potential Risks
### Quetions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement
- Are there any known external market factors (e.g., economic downturns, competitor movements) that could explain the decline?
- Were there any internal business decisions (pricing changes, distribution shifts) that might have contributed to lower sales?
- Which regions or product lines are currently receiving the most marketing and sales investments?
- Are there any upcoming strategic initiatives (e.g., product launches, expansions) that should be factored into this analysis?
- Are we targeting a geographic area or demographic group?
- Do we need to consider trends in neighboring markets or regions?
- Should external factors like economic conditions or promotions be incorporated into the analysis?
- Are there known supply chain constraints we need to account for in the recommendations?
- How flexible is the current inventory system for adjusting stock levels?
- Are there any resource limitations or supply chain constraints we should be aware of?
