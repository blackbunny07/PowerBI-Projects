# Project Purpose
This project assists businesses in optimizing their inventory management and predicting sales by analyzing trends in egg sales over time. Eggs, being a household staple, are a key influencer of grocery shopping behavior, reflecting both routine consumption patterns and seasonal demand fluctuations. By understanding these trends, businesses can avoid stockouts, and better align their operations with consumer needs.
# Executive Summary
Egg sales in a neighborhood of 100 houses averaged $1700 monthly during the pre-COVID-19 period of 2019. During the pandemic, monthly egg sales surged over 164%, from February 2020 to February 2021, reflecting heightened consumer demand. Despite challenge such as supply chain disruptions due to limited transportation, egg sales demonstrated resilience, eventually stabilizing at $800 per month post-pandemic.

This resilience underscores the critical role eggs play as a key driver of grocery shopping habits. Grocery stores can leverage these insights by expanding their inventory of eggs and complementary products often purchased alongside eggs. This strategic approach ensures grocery stores are well-stocked to meet customer needs during both routine and peak demand periods.

# Insights
### Sales Trends
- Sales average $20,000 annually in neighborhoods with 100 houses.
- A 164% surge in sales was observed during peak COVID-19 periods: February 2020 to February 2021.
- The quantities of brown and light brown eggs sold were more than double those of white and true blue eggs.

# Recommendations
### Maximizing Sales
- Increase the inventory of brown and light brown eggs while reducing the stock of white and true blue eggs to optimize storage space and align with demand trends.
- During periods of high food insecurity, increase the inventory of eggs and complementary products commonly purchased alongside them.
- Bundle eggs with complementary items (e.g., flour, sugar) in promotions or strategically display them together to drive additional sales.

# Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, Caveats, and Potential Risks
### Quetions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement
- How often should our findings or recommendations be revisited and updated?
- Are we targeting a geographic area or demographic group?
- Do we need to consider trends in neighboring markets or regions?
- Should external factors (like holidays, economic conditions, or promotions) be incorporated into the analysis?
- Are there known supply chain constraints we need to account for in the recommendations?
- How flexible is the current inventory system for adjusting stock levels?
- Which complementary products should we prioritize in bundling strategies?
- Are there any resource limitations (e.g., storage space, supplier capacity) we should be aware of?
### Assumptions
- **Data Accuracy:** The provided egg sales data is assumed to be accurate, complete, and representative of the entire neighborhood.
- **Consumer Behavior:** Consumer preferences for egg types (e.g., brown, white) are presumed to remain consistent over the analyzed period unless influenced by external factors (e.g., holidays, promotions).
- **Market Stability:** It is assumed that there are no significant external disruptions (e.g., new competitors, policy changes) beyond those explicitly accounted for, such as the impacts of COVID-19.
### Caveats
- **Small Sample Size:** The analysis is based on data from a single neighborhood and may not be generalizable to areas with different demographics or shopping behaviors.
- **Data Gaps:** Missing or incomplete sales data could distort trends or obscure valuable insights.
- **Seasonality and Holidays:** Seasonal fluctuations in sales may vary across years, affecting the reliability of trend predictions.
- **Consumer Preference Shifts:** Shifts in consumer preferences for certain egg types due to health trends or marketing campaigns were not forecasted in this analysis.
### Potential Risks
- **Inventory Overstocking:** Expanding inventory without accurate demand forecasts may lead to overstocking and product waste.
- **Bundling Limitations:** Strategies for bundling eggs with complementary products may not yield consistent results if consumer purchasing habits differ significantly across neighborhoods.
