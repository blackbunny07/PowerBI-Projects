# Project Purpose
this project analyzes sales performance trends over time of a global corporation, comparing Year-to-Date (YTD) sales against Previous Year-to-Date (PYTD) sales. By identifying key drivers of sales decline and product performance, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights to improve revenue, optimize product strategies, and address underperforming areas.
# Executive Summary
The sales performance analysis indicates a significant decline in YTD sales compared to PYTD, with an overall drop of $6.82M. The most substantial decline occurred between March and May, after which sales plateaued before showing minor recovery in Q4. All product categories (Indoor, Landscape, and Outdoor) contributed to this decline, with no single category outperforming expectations. Additionally, the bottom five performing countries (China, Brazil, Poland, Philippines, and France) reflect regions with severe sales underperformance.

# Insights
### Overall Sales Decline
- YTD sales total $1.78M, significantly lower than PYTD sales of $8.61M, reflecting a $6.82M decline.
- PYTD remains consistently higher than the YTD stacked columns, confirming a persistent negative sales trend.
### Quarterly Trends
- Q1 (January – March): Sales were initially stable, but early signs of decline began in March.
- Q2 (April – June): The most severe drop occurred during this period, with sales falling significantly below PYTD levels. This suggests an external or operational factor affecting revenue.
- Q3 (July – September): Sales stabilized but remained at a low level, indicating a plateau. This indicates a lack of corrective measures or ongoing market challenges.
- Q4 (October – December): A slight recovery occurred (+$0.1M), but it was insufficient to close the YTD vs PYTD gap.
### Product Category Performance
- Indoor, Landscape, and Outdoor products all experienced YTD sales drops.
- No category showed strong resilience, suggesting a broad market or operational issue rather than a product-specific weakness.
### Regional Underperformance
- China, Brazil, Poland, Philippines, and France are the worst-performing countries in terms of sales.
- These regions may require further investigation into market conditions, pricing strategies, or distribution issues.

# Recommendations
### Deep Dive into Q2 Sales Decline:
- Investigate potential external factors (market downturns, supply chain disruptions, competitive pressures).
- Review internal operations (pricing, inventory, marketing effectiveness).
### Market and Regional Strategy:
- Assess challenges in underperforming countries and adjust sales or marketing strategies accordingly.
- Conduct regional demand analysis to understand whether pricing, competition, or distribution issues are impacting sales.
### Product Category Adjustments:
- Identify product-specific issues through further segmentation of sales data.
- Consider repositioning or promotions to revive declining product categories.

# Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Potential Risks
### Quetions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement
- Are there any known external market factors (e.g., economic downturns, competitor movements) that could explain the decline?
- Were there any internal business decisions (pricing changes, distribution shifts) that might have contributed to lower sales?
- Which regions or product lines are currently receiving the most marketing and sales investments?
- Are there any upcoming strategic initiatives (e.g., product launches, expansions) that should be factored into this analysis?
- Are we targeting a geographic area or demographic group?
- Do we need to consider trends in neighboring markets or regions?
- Should external factors like economic conditions or promotions be incorporated into the analysis?
- Are there known supply chain constraints we need to account for in the recommendations?
- How flexible is the current inventory system for adjusting stock levels?
- Are there any resource limitations or supply chain constraints we should be aware of?
### Assumptions
- **Data Accuracy:** The provided egg sales data is assumed to be accurate, complete, and representative of the entire neighborhood.
- **Consumer Behavior:** Consumer preferences for egg types (e.g., brown, white) are presumed to remain consistent over the analyzed period unless influenced by external factors (e.g., holidays, promotions).
- **Market Stability:** It is assumed that there are no significant external disruptions (e.g., new competitors, policy changes) beyond those explicitly accounted for, such as the impacts of COVID-19.
### Potential Risks
**Failure to Identify the True Drivers of Sales Decline:**
- The overall $6.82M drop in sales could stem from multiple factors, including shifts in customer demand, competitor movements, supply chain issues, or internal pricing strategies. Without deeper segmentation, the business might focus on symptoms rather than root causes.
- Mitigation: Conduct granular analysis by product, region, and customer segment to pinpoint the exact causes of decline.
  
**Delayed Response to Underperforming Markets and Products**
- With China, Brazil, Poland, Philippines, and France ranking among the bottom five markets, failure to act swiftly could result in prolonged losses and loss of market share.
- Mitigation: Develop localized sales strategies, targeted promotions, or distribution optimizations to address regional weaknesses proactively.

**Overlooking the Role of Seasonality and External Market Factors**
- The data suggests a Q2 sales drop, a stagnant Q3, and a minor Q4 recovery, which could be due to seasonal demand fluctuations or macroeconomic shifts. If these factors aren’t considered, incorrect corrective actions may be taken.
- Mitigation: Incorporate historical seasonal trends, competitor benchmarking, and economic indicators into forecasting models.
